# virtual-zoo
This project has been created as part of a OOP modelling exercise during an interview process.

The animal classes created all extends the abstract class 'Animal'. This approach has been taken because all instances have been given a name field and share common functionality with the eat() method. This abstract class also contains an abstract method move().

A limitation of this approach is that Java objects can only inherit from a single parent. Another approach to mitigate this would be to use an interfaces to define the behaviour which the children must implement, this would provide greater flexibility.

Thanks for reading. Will be happy to discuss further.
